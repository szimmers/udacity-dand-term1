First, we needed to group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;




Here you can see that to get the entire original table was provided back. The additional portions of the query include an *, and we also needed to alias our table. Also the table was provided in the SELECT statement, not the FROM.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
           channel, COUNT(*) as events
     FROM web_events 
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;





Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.

SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
