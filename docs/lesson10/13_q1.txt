1. Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
   FROM sales_reps s
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
   JOIN orders o
   ON o.account_id = a.id
   JOIN region r
   ON r.id = s.region_id
   GROUP BY 1,2
   ORDER BY 3 DESC), 
t2 AS (
   SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
   FROM t1
   GROUP BY 1)
SELECT t1.rep_name, t1.region_name, t1.total_amt
FROM t1
JOIN t2
ON t1.region_name = t2.region_name AND t1.total_amt = t2.total_amt;



MINE:

WITH reps_sales AS (select sr.name as rep_name, rg.name as region_name, sum(o.total_amt_usd) as rep_total_sales_amt
            from sales_reps sr
            join accounts a
            on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            join region rg
            on sr.region_id = rg.id
            group by 1, 2),

amount_per_region AS (select region_name, MAX(rep_total_sales_amt) as total_amt from
        reps_sales
        group by 1
        order by 2)


select amount_per_region.region_name as region, reps_sales.rep_name as rep_name, reps_sales.rep_total_sales_amt as amount
    from amount_per_region
    join reps_sales
    on reps_sales.rep_total_sales_amt = amount_per_region.total_amt
