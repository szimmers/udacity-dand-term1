5. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
   FROM orders o
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.id = o.account_id
   GROUP BY a.id, a.name
   ORDER BY 3 DESC
   LIMIT 10)
SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM t1;



MINE:

WITH get_top10_accts_totals_spent AS (select a.id as account_id, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) totals
                from accounts a
                join orders o
                on o.account_id = a.id
                group by 1
                order by 2 desc
                limit 10)


select AVG(totals)
    from get_top10_accts_totals_spent
