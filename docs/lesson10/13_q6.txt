6. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for only the companies that spent more than the average of all accounts.

WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
   FROM orders o
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.id = o.account_id),
t2 AS (
   SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
   FROM orders o
   GROUP BY 1
   HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT * FROM t1))
SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM t2;


MINE:

WITH get_mean_total_amt AS (select AVG(o.total_amt_usd) total_avg
                            from orders o),

    get_accts_with_total_amt_gt_mean AS (select o.account_id acct_ids
                            from orders o
                            group by 1
                            HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (select total_avg from get_mean_total_amt))

select AVG(o.total_amt_usd)
    from orders o
    where o.account_id in (select acct_ids from get_accts_with_total_amt_gt_mean)
