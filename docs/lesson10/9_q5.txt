What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

First, we just want to find the top 10 accounts in terms of highest total_amt_usd.

SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

Now, we just want the average of these 10 amounts.

SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
      ORDER BY 3 DESC
       LIMIT 10) temp;


mine:

# this shows the top 10 and the avg for each
select a.name, AVG(o.total_amt_usd)
    from accounts a
    join orders o
    on o.account_id = a.id
    where a.id in
        (select account_id
            from (select a.id as account_id, SUM(o.total_amt_usd)
                from accounts a
                join orders o
                on o.account_id = a.id
                group by 1
                order by 2 desc
                limit 10) t1)
    group by 1
    order by 2 desc


# but i guess they wanted the avg for all of them

select AVG(totals)
    from (select a.id as account_id, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) totals
            from accounts a
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            group by 1
            order by 2 desc
            limit 10) t1
