3. For the account that purchased the most (in total of their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases? 

WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
  FROM accounts a
  JOIN orders o
  ON o.account_id = a.id
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
  LIMIT 1), 
t2 AS (
  SELECT a.name
  FROM orders o
  JOIN accounts a
  ON a.id = o.account_id
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total FROM t1))
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM t2;



MINE:

WITH get_highest_total AS (select SUM(o.standard_qty) as qty, SUM(o.total) as total
                                        from orders o
                                        join accounts a
                                        on a.id = o.account_id
                                        group by a.name
                                        order by 1 desc
                                        limit 1),

    get_acct_names_higher_total_purchases_than_cust_w_highest_std_qty AS (select a.name
        from orders o
        join accounts a
        on a.id = o.account_id
        group by 1
        having SUM(o.total) > (select total from get_highest_total))

select count(*)
    from get_acct_names_higher_total_purchases_than_cust_w_highest_std_qty
