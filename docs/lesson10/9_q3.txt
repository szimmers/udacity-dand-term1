3. For the account that purchased the most (in total of their lifetime as a customer) standard_qty paper, how many accounts still had more in total purchases? 

First, we want to find the account that had the most standard_qty paper. The query here pulls that account, as well as the total amount:

SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

Now, I want to use this to pull all the accounts with more total sales:

SELECT a.name
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) sub);

This is now a list of all the accounts with more total orders. We can get the count with just another simple subquery.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT a.name
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY 1
      HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) inner_tab)
            ) counter_tab;




MINE:

select count(*)
from (select a.name
    from orders o
    join accounts a
    on a.id = o.account_id
    group by 1
    having SUM(o.total) > (select total from
                                      (select SUM(o.standard_qty) as qty, SUM(o.total) as total
                                        from orders o
                                        join accounts a
                                        on a.id = o.account_id
                                        group by a.name
                                        order by 1 desc
                                        limit 1) t1
                                   )) t2
