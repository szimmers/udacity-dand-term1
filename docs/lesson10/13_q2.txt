2. For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed? 

WITH t1 AS (
   SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
   FROM sales_reps s
   JOIN accounts a
   ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
   JOIN orders o
   ON o.account_id = a.id
   JOIN region r
   ON r.id = s.region_id
   GROUP BY r.name), 
t2 AS (
   SELECT MAX(total_amt)
   FROM t1)
SELECT r.name, SUM(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (SELECT * FROM t2);



MINE:


WITH totals_per_region AS (select rg.id as region_id, rg.name as region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) as total
            from region rg
            join sales_reps sr
            on sr.region_id = rg.id
            join accounts a
            on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            group by 1, 2),

    highest_region_total AS (select MAX(totals_per_region.total)
        from totals_per_region
    )

select rg.name as region_name, SUM(o.total) as total_orders
    from region rg

    join sales_reps sr
    on sr.region_id = rg.id

    join accounts a
    on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id

    join orders o
    on o.account_id = a.id

    group by 1

    having SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (select * from highest_region_total)
