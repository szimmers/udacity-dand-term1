1. Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

First, I wanted to find the total_amt_usd totals associated with each sales rep, and I also wanted the region they were located. The query below provided this information.

SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

Next, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.

SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) inner1
     GROUP BY 1;

Essentially, this is a JOIN of these two tables, where the region and amount match.

SELECT t1.rep_name, t1.region_name, t1.total_amt
FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t1
JOIN (SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) inner1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
ON t1.region_name = t2.region_name AND t1.total_amt = t2.total_amt;



MINE:


select t2.region_name as region, t3.rep_name as rep_name, t3.rep_total_sales_amt as amount from
    (select region_name, MAX(rep_total_sales_amt) as total_amt from
        (select sr.name as rep_name, rg.name as region_name, sum(o.total_amt_usd) as rep_total_sales_amt
            from sales_reps sr
            join accounts a
            on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            join region rg
            on sr.region_id = rg.id
            group by 1, 2) t1
        group by 1
        order by 2) t2

    join
        (select sr.name as rep_name, rg.name as region_name, sum(o.total_amt_usd) as rep_total_sales_amt
            from sales_reps sr
            join accounts a
            on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            join region rg
            on sr.region_id = rg.id
            group by 1, 2) t3

        on t3.rep_total_sales_amt = total_amt
