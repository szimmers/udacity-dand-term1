2. For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed? 

The first query I wrote was to pull the total_amt_usd for each region.
SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name;

Then we want just want the region with the max amount from this table. There are two ways I considered getting this amount. One was to pull the max using a subquery. Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.

SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY r.name) sub;

Finally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:

SELECT r.name, SUM(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o
              ON o.account_id = a.id
              JOIN region r
              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);

This provides the Northeast with 1230378 orders




MINE:

select rg.name as region_name, SUM(o.total) as total_orders
from region rg

join sales_reps sr
on sr.region_id = rg.id

join accounts a
on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id

join orders o
on o.account_id = a.id

group by 1

having SUM(o.total_amt_usd) =
    (select MAX(t1.total) from
        (select rg.id as region_id, rg.name as region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) as total
            from region rg
            join sales_reps sr
            on sr.region_id = rg.id
            join accounts a
            on a.sales_rep_id = sr.id
            join orders o
            on o.account_id = a.id
            group by 1, 2) t1
    )
