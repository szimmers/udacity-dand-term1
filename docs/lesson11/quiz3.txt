1. In the accounts table, there is a column holding the website for each company.
The last three digits specify what type of web address they are using. A list
of extensions (and pricing) is provided here. Pull these extensions and provide how many of
each website type exist in the accounts table.

mine:

select distinct RIGHT(a.website, 3) as tld, COUNT(*) as count
from accounts a
group by 1
order by 2 desc

theirs:

SELECT RIGHT(website, 3) AS domain, COUNT(*) num_companies
FROM accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;



2. There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a company name matters).
Use the accounts table to pull the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of company names
that begin with each letter (or number).

mine:

select UPPER(LEFT(a.name, 1)) as first_letter, COUNT(*) as count
from accounts a
group by 1
order by 2 desc

theirs:

SELECT LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) AS first_letter, COUNT(*) num_companies
FROM accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;



3. Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups: one group of company names that start with
a number and a second group of those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of company names
start with a letter?

mine:

WITH get_first_char_counts AS (
    select name,
        CASE WHEN UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)) IN ('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9')
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS num_count,
        CASE WHEN UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)) IN ('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9')
            THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS char_count
    from accounts
)

select SUM(num_count) as num_counts, SUM(char_count) as char_counts
    from get_first_char_counts


theirs:

SELECT SUM(num) nums, SUM(letter) letters
FROM (SELECT name, CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9')
                       THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS num,
         CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9')
                       THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS letter
      FROM accounts) t1;


4. Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent
start with anything else?

mine:

WITH get_first_char_vowel_counts AS (
    select name,
        CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(name, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS vowel_count,
        CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(name, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
            THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS non_vowel_count
    from accounts
)

select SUM(vowel_count) as vowel_counts, SUM(non_vowel_count) as non_vowel_counts
    from get_first_char_vowel_counts


theirs:

SELECT SUM(vowels) vowels, SUM(other) other
FROM (SELECT name, CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
                        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS vowels,
          CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U')
                       THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS other
         FROM accounts) t1;
