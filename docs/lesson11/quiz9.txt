1. Each company in the accounts table wants to create an email address for each primary_poc.
The email address should be the first name of the primary_poc . last name primary_poc @ company name .com.

WITH email_parts AS (select LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') - 1) as first_name,
        RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) as last_name,
        REPLACE(name, ' ', '') as co_name
from accounts)

select CONCAT(LOWER(first_name), '.', LOWER(last_name), '@', LOWER(co_name), '.com')
from email_parts


theirs:

WITH t1 AS (
 SELECT LEFT(primary_poc,     STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name,  RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name, name
 FROM accounts)
SELECT first_name, last_name, CONCAT(first_name, '.', last_name, '@', name, '.com')
FROM t1;



2. You may have have noticed that in the previous solution some of the company names have spaces,
which will certainly not work as an email address. See if you can create an email that will work by removing all
of the spaces in the account name, but otherwise, your solution should be just as in question 1..
Some helpful documentation is here.

mine:

same as 1.

theirs:

WITH t1 AS (
 SELECT LEFT(primary_poc,     STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name,  RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name, name
 FROM accounts)
SELECT first_name, last_name, CONCAT(first_name, '.', last_name, '@', REPLACE(name, ' ', ''), '.com')
FROM  t1;



3. We would also like to create an initial password, which they will change after their first log in. The 
first password will be the first letter of the primary_poc's first name (lowercase), then the last letter of their 
first name (lowercase), the first letter of their last name (lowercase), the last letter of their last name 
(lowercase), the number of letters in their first name, the number of letters in their last name, and then the 
name of the company they are working with all capitalized with no spaces.
