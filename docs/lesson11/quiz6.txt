1. Use the accounts table to create a first and last name column that hold the first and last names for the primary_poc.

mine:

select LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') - 1) as first_name,
        RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) as last_name
from accounts


theirs:

SELECT LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') -1 ) first_name,
RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) last_name
FROM accounts;



2. Now see if you can do the same thing for all of the name of each rep in the sales_rep table.
Again provide a first and last name column.


mine:

select LEFT(name, STRPOS(name, ' ') - 1) as first_name,
        RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - STRPOS(name, ' ')) as last_name
from sales_reps


theirs:

SELECT LEFT(name, STRPOS(name, ' ') -1 ) first_name, 
       RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - STRPOS(name, ' ')) last_name
FROM sales_reps;
